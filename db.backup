For example, for how many products are you going to have the SPC chart and process control?\r\n\r\n2. How many % of the tool SPC you are creating?\r\n\r\n3.

I need targets to score against.\r\n\r\nFor example, something like for 3" wafer growth improvement, maybe you can say you will improve PL control to < 5nm within edge exclusion .

168	i) Litho process margin improvement, reduce defocus, resist footing\r\nBackground information: Frequent defocus, resist footing issue happen due to wafer topology and warpage issue, which is even more serious for Poet PLT layer and partial wafers. Exposure to use low vacuum contact is a good method to solve the issue. But due to scare of wafer broken, line is hesitate to use the method.\r\nStep 1: Identify the root cause of the issue[Done]\r\nStep 2: Solution procedure optimization[Done, to check wafer condition before use the mode, make sure no minor crack at wafer edge]\r\nStep 3: Solution implementation[Done, footing issue reduced. Even wafer edge see minor chipping, but no major impact to wafer]\r\nii) SPR220 bonding process stabilization\r\nResist bubble issue is the bottleneck to use SPR220 as the bonding material. I come out the idea that to do a short time exposure may solve the issue during the discussion with my pioneer. Subsequently we did the test and showed it's work.\r\nStep 1: Test with the exposure idea(flood exposure)[Done]\r\nStep 2: Test with 10 wafers process through[Done, it's work]\r\nStep 3: Margin check on exposure time and delay time to PEB[Done]\r\nStep 4: Implementation with engineering report[Done, ER #: 20-WP-ER-0006]	2020-06-30	2020-09-28	Completed	141

173	For SLED, the challenge is the high mix-low vol nature of the product family, therefore, yield needs to manage by product family sharing the same Epi/chip design and process flow. \r\n\r\nThough most of the yield improvement actions were planned before Xiaoyu joined, xiaoyu picked up very fast, and he can carried out analysis independently most of time and provide direction for yield improvement. He is still learning through OJT, but performance so far is satisfactory.	2020-12-02 02:57:55.437386+00	\N	861437177	461	265
174	So far xiaoyu has completed 4 SFO & 3 AFR sample test, and concluded AFR has better response time (meeting 4s spec) and power stability is also better than SFO.\r\n\r\nXiaoyu: please put down hypothesis and action plan to validate the hypothesis on worse power stability on SFO samples (given the scenario that we win Eloira NRE business and need to qualify SFO)	2020-12-02 06:53:12.290302+00	\N	861437177	462	265
175	Closed  3 RMAs with average 21 days cycle time. Met the 30 days target set by QA.\r\n\r\nPlease get the exact SLED RMA cases closed by PE from QA.	2020-12-02 06:55:16.78155+00	\N	861437177	463	265
176	Upon receiving the task, xiaoyu was still relatively new in DSL, but he still went into details on the market report, and put in extra effort to search and consolidate BW information btw DSL and key competitors, which greatly helped the management team to see the super bandwidth opportunity in 1310nm wavelength range in OCT market.	2020-12-02 07:05:17.249601+00	\N	861437177	465	265
177	Ronaldo joined DSL with strong test and programming background, which can greatly help DSL to enable a lot of test capability setup inhouse, test automation or semi-automation for UPH and cycle time improvement, as well as engineering work efficiency improve through many small scripts to speed up the data collection & compilation. \r\n\r\nTo make full use of his skillset, Ronaldo needs to establish a broader & long term view on how to integrate the scattered efforts from each function, and integrate them into a synchronized direction. This is one level higher than what he is supporting today.	2020-12-02 07:25:04.606489+00	\N	861437177	460	265
178	Ronaldo's strength is the quick data pulling and consolidation, and ensure data accuracy. On this perspective, Ronaldo is probably the fastest among all PE engineers. However, his weakness is on putting up the data in a logical order with good story line. Many time, he tends to focus very much on one particular piece of data, and forget to let management team knows the big picturial view and how is that data link to this picture and direction. \r\n\r\nSecondly, on the low SMSR yield troubleshooting, Ronaldo has not yet shown his ability to deep dive into the grating profile to the SMSR yield. To do that, Ronaldo needs to expose more & learn the analytical skills in making correlation of test yield to Epi structure, Wafer fab process & parameters and x-SEM etc.	2020-12-02 07:50:07.848387+00	\N	861437177	456	265
179	To enable the smooth transfer, Ronaldo needs to study through the phase gate meaning and checklist in details, understand the requirement to exit each phase gate, and define list of outstanding actions that NPD needs to close by each phase gate. Also, basic program management skill training has been provided to him to help him handle this project.	2020-12-02 07:58:08.992285+00	\N	861437177	458	265
180	So far, Ronaldo is very open and readily to take up additional work load or adhoc job assignment on test setup and automation, and he can always help the team greatlly to get engineering test results in an efficient manner.	2020-12-02 08:20:21.446537+00	\N	861437177	459	265

191	Leading 6 people from HiPP, PE, MOCVD, Fab B, Simulation, and NPD teams to bring up the broadband (1280 - 1700nm @ 70mW ) SLED for disruptive performance which will help DLS product road map.\r\n\r\nThe project is running at Phase 2.	2020-12-03 10:26:15.568347+00	\N	539619816	449	312
192	Supervising and mentoring 2 people bring their performances up to DLS expectations. \r\nIn addition, the product has been concentrated as follows: \r\n1. a. 1310 70mW@75C has been achieved by 500um (19141A). However, the die was not working as a DFB at 25C\r\n   b. 1310 70mW@75C has been achieved by 1000um (20132A). The previous issue has been eliminated by proper grating design and now die is showing DFB performance from 25C - 75C. However, due to high induced temp. die is misbehaving after 300mA driving current\r\nc. Few more wafers are in line to show the improvement in performance\r\n\r\n2.

However, the die was not working as a DFB at 25C\r\n   b. 1310 70mW@75C has been achieved by 1000um (20132A).

193	ELED test yield is mainly dominated by unstable and high variation of ripple yield loss. Team was working in parallel on variation control by identifying toggling factors like test, ridge etch profile etc, as well as laser chip design optimization (by adopting the SLED absorber & tapered ridge design). Carlan was working proactively and diligently on both paths. He was also learning by OJT on process & design factors toggling ripple.	2020-12-07 06:58:38.901971+00	\N	861437177	342	265
194	1) Have shipped a number of BF9C box with linewidth lower than 50Khz for samples. NPD still working on the 10khz versions. \r\n\r\n2) For panwoo, we have actually packaged successful BTF units with AFR and sent samples to customer. Now we are in the optimization phase to get better yield wafers and to increase the power.	2020-12-07 07:05:36.261017+00	\N	973701598	295	271
